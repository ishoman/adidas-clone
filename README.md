# _Adidas Clone_

#### _Clone of the DAME 4 SHOES page on adidas.com_

#### By _** Isaac Shoman**_

## Description

_Styled and created using only HTML and CSS. The prompt for this project was to clone a webpage that incorporates a grid layout. I chose the adidas page for a pair of basketball shoes and cloned it using Flexbox and CSS Grid. It was a fun experience after working with these layouts for a week. I couldn't clone it exactly as Adidas uses all custom fonts, so I chose a standard front from their font stack._
